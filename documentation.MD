# INTRODUCTION
Developer Career is _"A non-profit tech organization to support the rising tech ecosystem in Africa."_, as seen in [devcareer.io](https://devcareer.io). They offer junior and aspiring developers _"opportunity to be world class."_ As an aspiring/junior developer, if you have the *time*, *passion* and *zeal to learn*, Dev. Career seems to be the platform for you. (N.B: This is not a personal statement, this is backed by various testimonials of past interns). Check [here](https://devcareer.io) for full insight.


## GOAL IDENTIFICATION  
The Dev. Career site was built to help users to know why, and if they should apply to be admitted. As of the time of writing, my expertise lies in HTML, CSS, JS and the basics of Git V.C.S. I aim to revamp the Dev. Career site to the best of my abilities.

## SCOPE DEFINITION  
This section explains what need to be done, reasons include. I first visited [devcareer.io](https://devcareer.io) with my mobile phone. It didn't look nice to me. Aesthetically, there can be improvement: choice of illustrations, unclickable texts looking like buttons and so on.
Also, there are typographical and lexical errors which should be corrected and improved. Some examples include: *newsteller* instead of "newsletter", *apply?* instead of "apply". During the process of revision and improvement, I'll endeavour to give reasons for change of words for UX writing.

## SITEMAP AND WIREFRAME CREATION  
With the look of the site, I don't think there's need in creating a new sitemap. If it's needed, I won't hesitate to prepare one. Wireframe for the new look will be done in no time, and documentation updated. I'm trying to focus on copy writing for now, since my laptop isn't available.

## CONTENT CREATION  

### *Stay Updated* Section.
It says:
```
HEY! DevCareer, seems like I'll love to get your newsteller to know when your next program will be holding.
```
Some points to be highlighted:
- I feel *newsteller* meant *newsletter*. 
- The choice of pronoun doesn't seem right. A short sentence would be a better fit.
- According to an English dictionary, newsletter means *"A periodically sent publication containing current events or the like, generally on a particular topic or geared toward a limited audience."*. Use of *newsletter* for an act that is a *notification* is misleading. *P.S: I'm not experienced in the tech world, but I can volunteer to write newsletters for DevCareer, if needed :)*
- The input section has a placeholder which says, *"So I'll put my e-mail here right?"*. A shorter sentence should be a better fit.
- The submit button also shows *"I'm in"*. I don't need to be *in* for a reminder or newsletter, *subscribe* would be a better fit.

**Proffered change:**  
Header: Stay Ahead
Main: Subscribe to our newsletter to get updates about DevCareer and tech in Africa. Want to have a chat with people that have made it in with tech in Africa? Join our waiting list. || Join the developers newsletter waiting list
Placeholder: Enter email address
Submit Button: Keep Me Posted || Subscribe
Addendum: No spam, it'll come twice a month. You won't need it, but you can unsubscribe at any time.

### *Why we exist* Section.
Some points to be highlighted:  
- *"We are not planning to do much"* looks like a downplay, than an understatement.
- The whys look okay, but a VISION and MISSION might go a longer way.
- *Create employment*, or *create employable developers*?
- I don't see the relevance of *"Africa TechEcosystem++"* in this section.
- The illustration image used in this section doesn't match what the section's goal.

**Proffered change:**  
Header: Vision  
Main: To create world class Software Developers  
      To use tech as a tool in solving problems  
      To breed and promote creative ideas  
      To build more astute tech youths  
      To support females into tech in Africa  
      

### *Header* Section.
```
Developer Career. A non-profit Tech organization to support the rising Tech Ecosystem in Africa. A new day, another opportunity to be world class üî•üöÄ. Create mini CV
```
Some points to be highlighted:  
- What does *dev* mean in *DevCareer*? *developer or developers?*. Page header shows *developer career*, while page title shows *developers career*.
- Is *"A new day, another opportunity to be world class"* DevCareer's slogan? If not, a better tech quote might be needed.
- I tried clicking the mini-CV button, but I was directed to a sign up page. If that's what is intended, the button text is misleading.

**Proffered change:**  
Header: same  
Paragraph: same  
button text: sign up  
Arrange header contents to be hero-like.

### *Nav. Bar* Section.
It contains the logo and menu button, which works like an hamburger.  

**Proffered change:**  
Reduced logo size and maybe a little tweaking (I never said I make logos too, right?).  
Change menu to hamburger on mobile.  

### *Onboarding* Section.
