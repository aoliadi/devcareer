#INTRODUCTION
Developer Career is _"A non-profit tech organization to support the rising tech ecosystem in Africa."_, as seen in [devcareer.io] (https://devcareer.io). They offer junior and aspiring developers _"opportunity to be world class."_ As an aspiring/junior developer, if you have the *time*, *passion* and *zeal to learn*, Dev. Career seems to be the platform for you. (N.B: This is not a personal statement, this is backed by various testimonials of past interns). Check [here] (https://devcareer.io) for full insight.


##GOAL IDENTIFICATION  The Dev. Career site was built to help users to know why, and if they should apply to be admitted.
As of the time of writing, my core expertise lies in HTML, CSS, JS and the basics of Git Version Control System. I aim to revamp the Dev. Career site to the best of my abilities.
