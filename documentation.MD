#INTRODUCTION
Developer Career is _"A non-profit tech organization to support the rising tech ecosystem in Africa."_, as seen in [devcareer.io] (https://devcareer.io). They offer junior and aspiring developers _"opportunity to be world class."_ As an aspiring/junior developer, if you have the *time*, *passion* and *zeal to learn*, Dev. Career seems to be the platform for you. (N.B: This is not a personal statement, this is backed by various testimonials of past interns). Check [here] (https://devcareer.io) for full insight.


##GOAL IDENTIFICATION  The Dev. Career site was built to help users to know why, and if they should apply to be admitted. As of the time of writing, my expertise lies in HTML, CSS, JS and the basics of Git V.C.S. I aim to revamp the Dev. Career site to the best of my abilities.

##SCOPE DEFINITION  This section explains what need to be done, reasons include. I first visited [devcareer.io] (https://devcareer.io) with my mobile phone. It didn't look nice to me. Aesthetically, there can be improvement: choice of illustrations, unclickable texts looking like buttons and so on.
Also, there are typographical and lexical errors which should be corrected and improved - some of which I'll insert sscreenshots. Some examples include: *newlestter* instead of "newsletter". During the process of revision and improvement, I'll endeavour to give reasons for change of words for UX writing.

##SITEMAP AND WIREFRAME CREATION  With the look of the site, I don't think there's need in creating a new sitemap. If it's needed, I won't hesitate to prepare one. Wireframe for the new look will be done in no time, and documentation updated. I'm trying to focus on copy writing for now, since my laptop isn't available.

##CONTENT CREATION
