I should have started this 4weeks ago, but boom!, _transformer spoil_. I'm a writer who plans on writing everyday, but he doesn't have the discipline. So apart from flexing my finger muscles, I'm also working on my writing skills. Right now, I'm using SPCK editor on android (for the first time too), pending the time PHCN restores electricity. I wrote the reason I'm doing this in the [**documentation.MD**] (./documentation.MD) but I'll restate it and go further: **devcareer.io wasn't looking good, at least on my phone. So I started this so I'll get automatic admission :) into the next cohort of devcareer - cohort 3, I guess.** As I write this, I've never viewed it on PC. I hope to finish this before the next admission. Though, I don't know when it is coming up.  


+ 1st July, 2020: I heard **SPCK editor** enables pushing to github, so I installed it. I hope I'm committed from here on. Not much done today, I created the files, updated the documentation and plan for tomorrow and the future.
