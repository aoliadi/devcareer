I should have started this 4weeks ago, but boom!, _transformer spoil_. I'm a writer who plans on writing everyday, but he doesn't have the discipline. So apart from flexing my finger muscles, I'm also working on my writing skills. Right now, I'm using SPCK editor on android (for the first time too), pending the time PHCN restores electricity. I wrote the reason I'm doing this in the [documentation.MD](./documentation.MD) but I'll restate it and go further: **devcareer.io wasn't looking good, at least on my phone. So I started this so I'll get automatic admission :) into the next cohort of devcareer - cohort 3, I guess.** As I write this, I've never viewed it on PC. I hope to finish this before the next admission. Though, I don't know when it is coming up.  


+ 1st July, 2020: I heard **SPCK editor** enables pushing to github, so I installed it. I hope I'm committed from here on. Not much done today, I created the files, updated the documentation and plan for tomorrow and the future.  
+ 2nd July, 2020: I thought about this project, and felt I should read up on BEM naming technique. I know about it, but haven't studied it. Besides, I don't think I can work on this alone. Even if I can, I don't want to; after the landing page, I'll likely ask for more hands. So, looks like studying it will be of good help.  
+ 3rd July, 2020: I continued populating the documentation, and came up with some UX Copywriting. As I see this, it looks like it's gonna be a long walk. I haven't started BEM, I read more on CSS Grid today.  
+ 4th July, 2020: I proposed changes to the *stay updated* section of the documentation.  
+ 18th July, 2020: Ever since electricity was restored I've been quite busy on other stuffs. I read BEM. It's quite straightforward; maybe I don't understand it. Figma issues persist on my PC; and I still don't know why. Besides, I checked devcareer.io on PC. The *"would you love to apply?"* seems to make sense on PC. Maybe I'd just hide it on mobile. I'd get started with the wireframe soon.
